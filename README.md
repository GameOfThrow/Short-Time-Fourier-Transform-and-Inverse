# Short-Time-Fourier-Transform-and-Inverse
Applys the short time fourier transform and inverse of STFT in Matlab
The result is also sometimes known as a Spectrogram - used in signal processing.
The concept can be found here: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1164162/
The basics can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform

Note that matlab functions such as `fft` and `ifft` are used in the implementation.
